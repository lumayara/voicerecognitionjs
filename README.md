# VoicerecognitionJS with Azure Speech API (Cognitive Services) <br />
To make this run in your local. <br />
Go to Azure, create a SpeechAPI service under Cognitive Services. <br />
Record the Speech API key and the endpoint. Go to speaker-recognition-api-demo-core.js and place those values under the variables key and baseApi(URL endpoint) on the #1 and #2 lines. <br /><br />

Also, create a project on Firebase and a database. In this project I am using Firestore but Realtime database can also be used.
Get the firebase credentials .json and populate the needed fields in db.js.<br /><br />

This project was made using pure javascript so you can go ahead and test it in your browser by opening index.html <br /><br />

Have fun!
